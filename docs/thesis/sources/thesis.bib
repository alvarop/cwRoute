    abstract = {{Recent advances in miniaturization and low-cost, low-power design have led to active research in large-scale networks of small, wireless, low-power sensors and actuators. Time synchronization is critical in sensor networks for diverse purposes including sensor data fusion, coordinated actuation, and power-efficient duty cycling. Though the clock accuracy and precision requirements are often stricter than in traditional distributed systems, strict energy constraints limit the resources available to meet these goals.We present Reference-Broadcast Synchronization, a scheme in which nodes send reference beacons to their neighbors using physical-layer broadcasts. A reference broadcast does not contain an explicit timestamp; instead, receivers use its arrival time as a point of reference for comparing their clocks. In this paper, we use measurements from two wireless implementations to show that removing the sender's nondeterminism from the critical path in this way produces high-precision clock agreement (1.85 ± 1.28μsec, using off-the-shelf 802.11 wireless Ethernet), while using minimal energy. We also describe a novel algorithm that uses this same broadcast property to federate clocks across broadcast domains with a slow decay in precision (3.68 ± 2.57μsec after 4 hops). RBS can be used without external references, forming a precise relative timescale, or can maintain microsecond-level synchronization to an external timescale such as UTC. We show a significant improvement over the Network Time Protocol (NTP) under similar conditions.}},

@article{sampling:ganesan,
    abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have attracted attention from a diverse set of researchers, due to the unique combination of distributed, resource and data processing constraints. However, until now, the lack of real sensor network deployments have resulted in ad-hoc assumptions on a wide range of issues including topology characteristics and data distribution. As deployments of sensor networks become more widespread [1, 2], many of these assumptions need to be revisited.This paper deals with the fundamental issue of spatio-temporal irregularity in sensor networks We make the case for the existence of such irregular spatio-temporal sampling, and show that it impacts many performance issues in sensor networks. For instance, data aggregation schemes provide inaccurate results, compression efficiency is dramatically reduced, data storage skews storage load among nodes and incurs significantly greater routing overhead. To mitigate the impact of irregularity, we outline a spectrum of solutions. For data aggregation and compression, we propose the use of spatial interpolation of data (first suggested by Ganeriwal et al in [3] and temporal signal segmentation followed by alignment. To reduce the cost of data-centric storage and routing, we propose the use of virtualization, and boundary detection.}},

The central idea is to exploit the large number of global constraints that have to be satisfied by a common notion of time in a multihop network. If, at a certain instant, O ij  is the clock offset between two neighboring nodes i and j, then for any loop i 1 , i 2 , i 3  , ..., i n , i n + 1  - i 1  in the multihop network, these offsets must satisfy the global constraint Sigma  k = 1   n O ik , i k + 1  = 0. Noisy estimates Ocirc  ij  of O ij  are usually arrived at by bilateral exchanges of timestamped messages or local broadcasts. By imposing the large number of global constraints for all the loops in the multihop network, these estimates can be smoothed and made more accurate. A fully distributed and asynchronous algorithm which functions by simple local broadcasts is designed. Changing the time reference node for synchronization is also easy, consisting simply of one node switching on adaptation, and another switching it off.

This paper describes the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP), especially tailored for applications requiring stringent precision on resource limited wireless platforms. The proposed time synchronization protocol uses low communication bandwidth and it is robust against node and link failures. The FTSP achieves its robustness by utilizing periodic flooding of synchronization messages, and implicit dynamic topology update. The unique high precision performance is reached by utilizing MAC-layer time-stamping and comprehensive error compensation including clock skew estimation. The sources of delays and uncertainties in message transmission are analyzed in detail and techniques are presented to mitigate their effects. The FTSP was implemented on the Berkeley Mica2 platform and evaluated in a 60-node, multi-hop setup.

@inproceedings{synchronization:TPSN,
    abstract = {{Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks have emerged as an interesting and important research area in the last few years. The applications envisioned for such networks require collaborative execution of a distributed task amongst a large set of sensor nodes. This is realized by exchanging messages that are time-stamped using the local clocks on the nodes. Therefore, time synchronization becomes an indispensable piece of infrastructure in such systems. For years, protocols such as NTP have kept the clocks of networked systems in perfect synchrony. However, this new class of networks has a large density of nodes and very limited energy resource at every node; this leads to scalability requirements while limiting the resources that can be used to achieve them. A new approach to time synchronization is needed for sensor networks.In this paper, we present Timing-sync Protocol for Sensor Networks (TPSN) that aims at providing network-wide time synchronization in a sensor network. The algorithm works in two steps. In the first step, a hierarchical structure is established in the network and then a pair wise synchronization is performed along the edges of this structure to establish a global timescale throughout the network. Eventually all nodes in the network synchronize their clocks to a reference node. We implement our algorithm on Berkeley motes and show that it can synchronize a pair of neighboring motes to an average accuracy of less than 20ms. We argue that TPSN roughly gives a 2x better performance as compared to Reference Broadcast Synchronization (RBS) and verify this by implementing RBS on motes. We also show the performance of TPSN over small multihop networks of motes and use simulations to verify its accuracy over large-scale networks. We show that the synchronization accuracy does not degrade significantly with the increase in number of nodes being deployed, making TPSN completely scalable.}},

GTSP works in a completely decentralized fashion: Every node periodically broadcasts its time information. Synchronization messages received from direct neighbors are used to calibrate the logical clock. The algorithm requires neither a tree topology nor a reference node, which makes it robust against link and node failures. The protocol is implemented on the Mica2 platform using TinyOS.

@inproceedings{synchronization:VHT,

We achieve this performance by revisiting a basic assumption in the design of time-keeping systems -- that to achieve a given time-stamping resolution, a free-running timebase of equivalent frequency is needed. We show that this assumption is false and argue that the dependence is not on usage (i.e. whether on or off) but rather on access (i.e. reading and writing). Therefore, it is possible to duty cycle the free-running timebase itself, and augment it with a lower-frequency, temperature-compensated one, which achieves comparable resolution, at a fraction of the power, for typical workloads. The key technical challenge lies in duty cycling the fast clock and synchronizing the fast and slow clocks. To assess the viability of the approach, we explore how VHT could be implemented on several different platform architectures, and to study the power/performance tradeoff, we characterize VHT on one particular architecture in detail. Our results show power-proportional operation with a 10x improvement in average power and a synchronization accuracy exceeding 1 μs at duty cycles below 0.1\%.}},

Mobile nodes are synchronized via in-band software synchronization within the same framework. We identify three key observations in the design and deployment of RT-link: (a) hardware-based global-time synchronization is a robust and scalable option to in-band software-based techniques, (b) achieving global time-synchronization is both economical and convenient for indoor and outdoor deployments, (c) RT-link achieves a practical lifetime of over 2 years.

@article{mac:lowdutycycle,
    abstract = {This paper presents an energy-efficient medium access control protocol suitable for communication in a wireless body area network for remote monitoring of physiological signals such as {EEG} and {ECG}. The protocol takes advantage of the static nature of the body area network to implement the effective time-division multiple access ({TDMA}) strategy with very little amount of overhead and almost no idle listening (by static, we refer to the fixed topology of the network investigated). The main goal is to develop energy-efficient and reliable communication protocol to support streaming of large amount of data. {TDMA} synchronization problems are discussed and solutions are presented. Equations for duty cycle calculation are also derived for power consumption and battery life predictions. The power consumption model was also validated through measurements. Our results show that the protocol is energy efficient for streaming communication as well as sending short bursts of data, and thus can be used for different types of physiological signals with different sample rates. The protocol is implemented on the analog devices {ADF7020} {RF} transceivers.},

@inproceedings{mac:tdma,
    abstract = {Body area networks ({BAN}) are a specific type of network structure. They are spread over a very small area and their available power is heavily constrained. Hence it is useful to have gateway points in the network, such as nodes carried around the belt, that are less power constrained and can be used for network coordination. This network structure can result in very low transmission power/range for the sensors and effective {TDMA} timing control. This paper presents an energy-efficient {MAC} protocol for communication within the wireless body area network. The protocol takes advantage of the fixed nature of the body area network to implement a {TDMA} strategy with very little communication overhead, long sleep times for the sensor transceivers and robustness to communication errors. The protocol is implemented on the analog devices {ADF7020} {RF} transceivers.},

    abstract = {A wireless communication platform for {ECG} operating in the unlicensed 2.4-2.4835 {GHz} band is proposed and analyzed. The platform uses relaying of creeping waves to drastically reduce sensor transmission power while maintaining reliable performance. A point to point link budget is designed based on the creeping wave component of the propagating signal. The link budget is then integrated into a body sensor network design. System management details are presented and discussed. Performance metrics including scalability of the system and network lifetime are evaluated. The proposed design is shown to achieve a dramatic 1.5 × 10 5  increase in battery life for mobile scenarios compared to a reference system without relaying. In addition, it is shown that the design may scale to support applications that demand higher data rates than {ECG}.},

@inproceedings{protocol:CICADA,
    abstract = {Wireless body area networks ({WBANs}) form a new and interesting area in the world of remote health monitoring. An important concern in such networks is the communication between the sensors. This communication needs to be energy efficient and highly reliable while keeping delays low. Mobility also has to be supported as the nodes are positioned on different parts of the body that move with regard to each other. In this paper, we present a new cross-layer communication protocol for {WBANs}: {CICADA} or Cascading Information retrieval by Controlling Access with Distributed slot Assignment. The protocol sets up a network tree in a distributed manner. This tree structure is subsequently used to guarantee collision free access to the medium and to route data towards the sink. The paper analyzes {CICADA} and shows simulation results. The protocol offers low delay and good resilience to mobility. The energy usage is low as the nodes can sleep in slots where they are not transmitting or receiving.},

@inproceedings{protocol:WASP,

Current implementations generally use a large single hop network to connect all sensors to a personal server. However recent research pointed out that multihop networks are more energy-efficient and even necessary when applied near the human body with inherent severe propagation loss. In this paper we present a slotted multihop approach to medium access control and routing in wireless body area networks, the wireless autonomous spanning tree protocol or {WASP}. It uses crosslayer techniques to achieve efficient distributed coordination of the separated wireless links. Traffic in the network is controlled by setting up a spanning tree and by broadcasting scheme messages over it that are used both by the parent and the children of each node in the tree. We analyze the performance of {WASP} and show the simulation results},

@article{survey:wirelessrouting,
    abstract = {Wireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for {WSNs} where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in {WSNs} might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in {WSNs}. We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in {WSNs} followed by a comprehensive survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based, {QoS}-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages and performance issues of each routing technique. The article concludes with possible future research areas.},

A prototype {WBAN} has been constructed for experimentally characterizing on-body topology disconnections in the presence of ultra short range radio links, unpredictable {RF} attenuation, and human postural mobility. A location based packet routing protocol is then developed. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated experimentally, and is compared with a generic probabilistic routing protocol and a specialized on-body packet flooding mechanism that provides the routing delay lower-bounds. It is shown that via successfully leveraging the node location information, the proposed algorithm can provide better routing delay performance compared to existing probabilistic routing protocols in the literature.},

@inproceedings{relay:transmitpoweradaptation,
    abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks ({WBANs}) have characteristic properties that should be considered for designing a proper network architecture. Movement of on-body sensors, low quality and time-variant wireless links, and the demand for a reliable and fast data transmission at low energy cost are some challenging issues in {WBANs}. Using ultra low power wireless transceivers to reduce power consumption causes a limited transmission range. This implies that a multi-hop protocol is a promising design choice. This paper proposes a multi-hop protocol for human body health monitoring. The protocol is robust against frequent changes of the network topology due to posture changes, and variation of wireless link quality. A technique for adapting the transmit power of sensor nodes at run-time allows to optimize power consumption while ensuring a reliable outgoing link for every node in the network and avoiding network disconnection.
